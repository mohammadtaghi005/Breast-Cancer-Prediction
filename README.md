This project aims to predict breast cancer using several machine-learning classification models. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from the UCI repository contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cell nuclei.

The Jupyter Notebook walks through loading, exploring the data, and preprocessing steps like handling missing values and converting categorical features to numeric ones. Baseline models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest are implemented using Scikit-Learn. The models are evaluated and compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC metrics.

Key techniques employed include data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and cross-validation to combat overfitting. Visualizations including correlation plots and confusion matrices provide additional insight into model performance.

The XG_BOOST classifier achieved the best performance. This end-to-end implementation serves as a guide for applying core machine learning concepts to classify and predict breast cancer from medical imaging data.
